#we can take string and asssign a name to it using an equals sign we call this
# a variable#
# first store a short DNA Sequence in the variable my_dna

my_dna="ATGCGTA"

# We basically assigned a a strind into a variable. Which means that the variable
# my_dna now points to the string "ATGCGTA". We call this assigning a variable and
# now we can use the variable instead of the string itselfself.
 # NOW WE CAN ALSO PRINT THE STRING BY CALLING VARIABLE##

print(my_dna)

# NO NEED FOR ANY QUOTATIONS MARK FOR VARIABLE WHEN WE USE IT WITH PRINT STATEMENT##
